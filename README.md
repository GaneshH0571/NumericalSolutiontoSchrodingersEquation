# Numerical Solution to radial Schrodingers Equation

This code provides a numerical solution to the radial schrodingers equation for single electron species and aims to give the wavefunctions of the species for parametric potential models which closely simulates the real life eigen values of the wavefunctions.To acheive this we employ numerical techniques such as the multi step Adams method , Inward and Outward Integration to give us the wavefunction values from either side of the chosen limits upon which we calculate the values . Currently our code obtains the eigen values for the coulumb potential with percentage error of order 0.01 but is facing some convergence issues with the parametric potentials and has slight error from the values which we are expecting
